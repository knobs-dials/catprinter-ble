# What

This prints images and text to a cat-shaped printer. 
- lets you input text (will render that text as image with a font first)
- lets you input images - plus zoom, brightness, contast, and rotation options

Tested 
* on win, lin, and osx; 
* towards the printer I have, which reports as an MX06 (and the bluetooth code this is based on mentions a handful of others)
  * Note that there are models that are classic bluetooth only -- for which python support is awkward. I'm working on options (watch [this issue](https://github.com/knobs-dials/catprinter-ble/issues/1) to see if I ever do), but in practice you might buy one that this software cannot talk to, and it's hard to tell that before buying 
* not yet tested on all browsers.


# How (install)

Requirements:
- **python3**
  - **`pillow`** library (for image processing)
  - **`bleak`** library (for bluetooth)
  - **`flask`** (could be stripped out)
- **bluetooth hardware** (probably a laptop, though this was actually developed on a windows desktop with a USB dongle)

In ubuntu, either use a virtualenv, or do a system-wide install -- ubuntu now makes you use package installs rather than pip installs, so try `apt install python3-pillow python3-bleak python3-flask`

In other linux, windows, and OSX, `pip install -r requirements.txt` should work - assuming you already had python.
Preferably in a virualenv.


# How (run)

Find a computer that can talk bluetooth, and run `python catprint.py`

(on windows, assuming you have a python installed, you can avoid opening a cmd window first by double-clicking  `run.bat`)

This will 
- start the little server that uses local bluetooth hardware to find the first applicable printer (reports its connection state in the browser tab)
- starts a browser tab for you to poke at this server

# What, more technically

A little more technically, it is:
- the server handles bluetooth communication, image conversion, and is a HTTP server...
- ...that serves a web page, to contact itself for you to poke at 

As-is it's meant to be viewed from the same host,
but it was written in a way that makes it easy enough 
to make this a network service so that you can e.g. have a printer be a physical notification thing.

As long as that server is running, it tries to keep the bluetooth connection established - and the cat printer awake.
This in part because one of its uses would be to leave it on a charger and make it the already-mentioned physical notification thing, 
[like the author of some of the code we used did](https://dev.to/mitchpommers/my-textable-cat-printer-18ge) - see also the original code mentioned below.

This code started off from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mpomery/6514e521d3d03abce697409609978ede) but adds some more robustness and flexibility,
and an interface that loosely imitates [this project's interface](https://github.com/NaitLee/Cat-Printer) (though with simpler, slower code).

Most image processing is done on the browser side; the resulting image is then sent to the backend.


# TODO

Allow rotation, controlled from the UI.
